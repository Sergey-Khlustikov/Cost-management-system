Here you should create a category (for income, outcome, both). Come up with a name and specify a money spending limit.
For example, category **Food** with **1000** limit.

After creating a category, you can edit it.

You should select a category, type (income or outcome), enter the amount and description.

You will not be able to create a record if the specified amount exceeds your bill

After the post is created it gets to the history page, your bill changes depending on the specified amount.

### Planning page
